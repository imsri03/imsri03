### About Me

[cite_start]I'm a results-driven Data Engineer with over 4 years of experience specializing in building scalable, secure, and high-performance data platforms across cloud and hybrid environments. [cite_start]My core expertise lies in architecting modern data solutions that empower analytics, reporting, and AI-driven decision-making[cite: 4]. I am particularly adept at ETL/ELT pipeline development, ensuring efficient data ingestion, transformation, and validation for complex data ecosystems.

* [cite_start]**ETL Expertise:** Built robust batch and streaming pipelines using Apache Spark, Databricks, Kafka, Airflow, Azure Data Factory (ADF), and dbt, integrating data from various sources like APIs, databases, and third-party systems[cite: 5]. I'm passionate about developing efficient and automated ETL workflows to deliver reliable and timely data.
* [cite_start]**Cloud & Data Platforms:** Experienced in designing and developing modern data architectures on AWS, Azure, and GCP, leveraging services like Snowflake, Redshift, Synapse, S3, and Databricks for scalable processing[cite: 6, 14].
* [cite_start]**Data Modeling & Warehousing:** Modeled and optimized data warehouses and marts using Star Schema, Snowflake, and OLAP, delivering low-latency data for analytics and reporting[cite: 7, 14].
* [cite_start]**DevOps & Automation:** Built robust CI/CD pipelines using Terraform, Jenkins, and GitHub Actions, and containerized deployments with Docker and Kubernetes[cite: 10, 14].
