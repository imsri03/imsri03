### About Me

I'm a results-driven Data Engineer with over 4 years of experience specializing in building scalable, secure, and high-performance data platforms across cloud and hybrid environments. My core expertise lies in architecting modern data solutions that empower analytics, reporting, and AI-driven decision-making. I am particularly adept at ETL/ELT pipeline development, ensuring efficient data ingestion, transformation, and validation for complex data ecosystems.

* **ETL Expertise:** Built robust batch and streaming pipelines using Apache Spark, Databricks, Kafka, Airflow, Azure Data Factory (ADF), and dbt, integrating data from various sources like APIs, databases, and third-party systems. I'm passionate about developing efficient and automated ETL workflows to deliver reliable and timely data.
* **Cloud & Data Platforms:** Experienced in designing and developing modern data architectures on AWS, Azure, and GCP, leveraging services like Snowflake, Redshift, Synapse, S3, and Databricks for scalable processing.
* **Data Modeling & Warehousing:** Modeled and optimized data warehouses and marts using Star Schema, Snowflake, OLAP, and delivered low-latency data for analytics and reporting.
* **DevOps & Automation:** Built robust CI/CD pipelines using Terraform, Jenkins, and GitHub Actions, and containerized deployments with Docker and Kubernetes.
